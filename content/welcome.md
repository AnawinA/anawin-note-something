# Welcome! 👋

This is your personal note-taking website — a place to **note everything**.

## Getting Started

Write your notes in Markdown. Here's a quick reference:

- **Bold text** with `**double asterisks**`
- *Italic text* with `*single asterisks*`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ with `~~double tilde~~`

## What You Can Do

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Notes | Browse all your notes in gallery or list view |
| Search | Find anything instantly |
| Tags | Organize by topic |
| History | See what you've recently read |
| Dark Mode | Easy on the eyes at night |

## Example Code

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Return a warm greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to your notes."

print(greet("Anawin"))
```

## Tips

1. Use **frontmatter** to set title, date, tags, and image
2. Notes in folders are organized by path (e.g. `language/japanese.md`)
3. Use `draft: true` to keep notes private (visible only in dev mode)

Enjoy your notes! ✨
